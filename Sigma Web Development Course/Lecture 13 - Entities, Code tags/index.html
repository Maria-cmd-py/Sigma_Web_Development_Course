    <h1>What are HTML Entities?</h1>
    <p>HTML entities are special characters that are used to represent certain symbols or characters in HTML. They are often used to display characters that have a special meaning in HTML, such as <, >, and &.</p>
    <h2>Common HTML Entities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>&amp; - Ampersand (&)</li>
        <li>&lt; - Less than (<)</li>
        <li>&gt; - Greater than (>)</li>
        <li>&quot; - Double quote (")</li>
        <li>&#39; - Single quote (')</li>
        <li>&nbsp; - Non-breaking space</li>
        <li>&copy; - Copyright symbol (Â©)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Usage of HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>HTML entities are used to ensure that the HTML code is correctly interpreted by web browsers. For example, if you want to display a less than sign (<) in your HTML content, you would use the entity &lt; instead of the actual character. This prevents the browser from interpreting it as the start of an HTML tag.</p>
    <h3>Real Life Example</h3>
    3>4 This is the code for Paragraph:
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    <p> Pre Tag are used to display code as it is as we write in the pre tag.</p>
    <pre>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>



        This Will appear after few Lines      after more lines of code.
    </pre> 
    <blockquote>
        This is a blockquote.
    </blockquote>
